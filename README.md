# Robot Car with Obstacle Avoidance

## Overview

The **Robot Car with Obstacle Avoidance** project demonstrates a simple autonomous robot car that uses an ultrasonic sensor to avoid obstacles. This robot car is controlled by an Arduino microcontroller and features two DC motors for movement. The car moves forward until it detects an obstacle within a predefined distance, at which point it stops and turns to avoid the obstacle.

## Features

- Autonomous navigation with obstacle avoidance.
- Real-time distance measurement using an ultrasonic sensor.
- Basic motor control to move forward, stop, and turn.

## Hardware Requirements

- **Microcontroller:** Arduino (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- **Motors:** 2 DC motors with motor driver (e.g., L298N or L293D)
- **Sensor:** Ultrasonic distance sensor (e.g., HC-SR04)
- **Miscellaneous:** Breadboard, jumper wires, power supply

## Software Requirements

- **IDE:** Arduino IDE
- **Libraries:** None required for this basic example

## Installation
